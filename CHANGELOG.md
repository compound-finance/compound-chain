# New Event Ingression System [m10]

This release introduces a new event ingression system. This system properly handles re-organizations of the Ethereum chain. Additionally, the system introduces a risk system to ingress high-value lock events with an exponential decay.

We additionally introduce a REPL to connect a shell to test-net and make a variety of internal improvements to the internal code. We continue to add greater test coverage.
