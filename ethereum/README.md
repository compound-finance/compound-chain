# Ethereum Cash Token and Starport

## Getting Started

First, you'll need to install the deps, including [Saddle](https://github.com/compound-finance/saddle), which is used for contract management and testing.

```sh
yarn install
```

## Compiling Contracts

You will need `solc` 8.0.1 to be installed and available as `solc`. See solc and saddle documentation for choosing a compiler binary.

```sh
yarn compile
```

This will compile your contracts to the `.build` directory.

## Testing Contracts

To test your contracts via Jest from saddle, run:

```sh
yarn test
```

## Deployment

You can deploy the Starport with the following command:

```
npx saddle script -n ropsten deploy 0x2079A734292094702f4D7D64A59e980c20652Cae
```

where `0x2079A734292094702f4D7D64A59e980c20652Cae` is the admin, e.g. the Compound Timelock.

## Console

You can connect to a repl for deployed contracts with the following command:

```sh
yarn console -n ropsten

> await starport.methods.cash().call();
```

## Contributing

Please open a pull request, issue or discuss in the Compound governance forums for all changes. Note: the `master` branch of this repo will attempt to match the main-net deployed contracts and not the future development of these contracts.
